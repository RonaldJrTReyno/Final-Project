                        This term refers to the long-term shifts of the average weather condition that define all of Earth's regional and global climates. These shifts include changes in the average temperatures, weather conditions, and sea levels. Climate change can be natural due to major volcanic eruptions, or the activtiy of the sun. However, for the past few centuries, human activity has quickened these changes to an unnatural pace, which has led to harmful effects to the environment and its inhabitants.

                    <h4 class = section2-text>
                        There are many ways we can contribute to address this growing problem. They range from disposing waste properly, i. e. follow the 3Rs, conserving energy such as switching off devices when not in use, and utilizing sustainable transporation like buses and public vehicles. Aside from that, there are collective actions we can also do as groups of individuals, including supporting government policies that have a positive impact to the environment, favoring sustainable practices in businesses, and investing in research and development on renewable energy sources.
