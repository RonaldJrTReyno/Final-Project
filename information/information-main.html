            <div class = "pollutiondescription">Pollution is the leading cause of climate change. It is defined as
            the introduction or addition of materials or energy to the environment faster than they can be dispersed or
            decomposed. There are three major types of pollution - air, land, and water.</div>

            <h2 class = airtitle>Air</h2>
            <h3 class = airdescription> Considered as the most impactful of the three, air pollution severly affects
                the biodiversity of life in many ecosystems around the world by contaminating the air with harmful chemical,
                physical, or biological agents. Not only that, it also has harmful effects to human life. On average,
                air pollution causes the deaths of approximately seven million individuals annually.

            <h3 class = landdescription> Another type of pollution that involves the deposition or
                improper disposal of solid and liquid waste on land, which leads to the contamination
                of the soil and groundwater. It imposes health risks to human inhabitants near
                contaminated areas as the chance of outbreak of vector-borne diseases
                and illnesses transmitted by rodents, insects, or other pests and animals are increased.

            <h2 class = watertitle>Water</h2>
            <h3 class = waterdescription> Water pollution is the release of chemicals, biohazards, wastes,
                or other harmful substances, to water or marine environments. It poses a severe risk to
                underwater organisms and animals, as it introduces toxic conditions to these life forms.
                Furthermore, it also encourages the transmission of water-borne diseases such as cholera 
                and typhoid fever, which can impact numerous communities.
