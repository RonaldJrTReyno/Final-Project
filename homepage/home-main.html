                    <h3 class = ccdescription> This term refers to the long-term 
                        shifts of the average weather condition that define all of
                        Earth's regional and global climates. These shifts include
                        changes in the average temperatures, weather conditions,
                        and sea levels. Climate change can
                        be natural due to major volcanic eruptions, or the
                        activtiy of the sun. However, for the past few centuries,
                        human activity has quickened these changes to an unnatural pace,
                        which has led to harmful effects to the environment and
                        its inhabitants.

                    <h3 class = acdescription> There are many ways we can contribute to address
                        this growing problem. They range from disposing waste properly, i. e.
                        follow the 3Rs, conserving energy such as switching off devices
                        when not in use, and utilizing sustainable transporation like buses
                        and public vehicles. Aside from that, there are collective actions we can
                        also do as groups of individuals, including supporting government policies
                        that have a positive impact to the environment, favoring sustainable
                        practices in businesses, and investing in research and development on renewable
                        energy sources.
