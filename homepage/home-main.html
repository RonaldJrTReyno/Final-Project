            <h3 class = ccdescription> This term refers to the long-term 
                shifts of the average weather condition that define all of
                Earth's regional and global climates. These shifts include
                changes in the average temperatures, weather conditions,
                and sea levels. Climate change can
                be natural due to major volcanic eruptions, or the
                activtiy of the sun. However, for the past few centuries,
                human activity has quickened these changes to an unnatural pace,
                which has led to harmful effects to the environment and
                its inhabitants.

            <h3 class = acdescription> There are many ways we can contribute to address
                this growing problem. They range from disposing waste properly, i. e.
                follow the 3Rs, conserving energy such as switching off devices
                when not in use, and utilizing sustainable transporation like buses
                and public vehicles. Aside from that, there are collective actions we can
                also do as groups of individuals, including supporting government policies
                that have a positive impact to the environment, favoring sustainable
                practices in businesses, and investing in research and development on renewable
                energy sources.
